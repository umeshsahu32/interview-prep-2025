// You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

// Input: s = "abba"
// Output: true
// Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

// Input: s = "abc"
// Output: false
// Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
