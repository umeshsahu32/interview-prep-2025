// Given an unsorted array arr of positive integers. One number a from the set [1, 2,....,n] is missing and one number b occurs twice in the array. Find numbers a and b.

// Note: The test cases are generated such that there always exists one missing and one repeating number within the range [1,n].

// Examples:

// Input: arr[] = [2, 2]
// Output: [2, 1]
// Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.

// Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3]
// Output: [3, 2]
// Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.

// Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1]
// Output: [1, 5]
// Explanation: Repeating number is 1 and the missing number is 5.
