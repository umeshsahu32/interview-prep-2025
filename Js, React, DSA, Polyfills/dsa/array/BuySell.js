// You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

// You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

// Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

// Example 1:
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

// Example 2:
// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
