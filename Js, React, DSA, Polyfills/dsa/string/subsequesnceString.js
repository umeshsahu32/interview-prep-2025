// Given a string, we have to find out all its subsequences of it. A String is said to be a subsequence of another String, if it can be obtained by deleting 0 or more character without changing its order.

// Examples:

// Input : ab
// Output : "", "a", "b", "ab"

// Input : abc
// Output : "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"
